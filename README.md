NoobMode
========

NoobMode is a very simple plugin to help new users get used to the VIM way of doing things. When enabled, it does two simple things:

* Disable the arrow keys.
* Differentiate between Insert/Normal mode using the StatusLine.

To enable/disable run:

```bash
:NoobMode
```

To install using Pathogen include this entire folder inside your 'bundle' folder.
